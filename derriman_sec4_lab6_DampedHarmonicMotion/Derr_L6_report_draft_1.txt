 **INTRODUCTION**
In this experiment, we studied the motion of a harmonic oscillator. Initially, we observed the undamped oscillation of a mass attached to a spring, examining its natural behavior. In the second part of the experiment, we introduced damping by attaching a paper plate to the mass, which increased air resistance. This allowed us to compare undamped and damped harmonic motion, focusing on how the damping force affects the system's oscillations.

**BACKGROUND**

The motion of a harmonic oscillator can be described using the equation of a simple harmonic motion, where the mass , spring constant , and displacement determine the motion. In the absence of external forces, the system undergoes **undamped harmonic motion** with a natural frequency given by:

In the second part of the experiment, we introduce damping by attaching a paper plate to the mass. The added air resistance leads to **damped harmonic motion**, which can be characterized by the general equation:

where  is the damping coefficient, which represents the resistance force acting against the motion of the oscillator. This damping force is proportional to the velocity of the mass and reduces the amplitude of oscillations over time. This equation describes **underdamped motion** when the damping force is not strong enough to completely halt oscillations. In this scenario, the system oscillates with a damped angular frequency:

The damping causes the amplitude of the oscillations to decay over time, following an exponential decay model. The relationship between the natural frequency and the damped frequency allows us to understand how the system's energy dissipates due to air resistance.

Least-squares fitting was used to analyze our data, particularly for fitting the decay in amplitude and extracting the damping coefficient. This method minimizes the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed values and those predicted by the model, giving us a reliable way to quantify the damping effect.

**PROCEDURE**

In parts A and B, we set up the experiment by hanging a mass from a spring suspended from a force transducer to measure force, while an ultrasonic position sensor was placed below the mass to track its motion. The force transducer was connected to the analog CH1 input on the LabPro interface, and the ultrasonic sensor was connected to the DIG/SONIC1 connector. Data was collected using LoggerPro software, with a sampling rate of 30 samples per second and a collection time of 10 seconds to capture several oscillation cycles.

In part C, we determined the spring constant by measuring the displacement of the spring with different added masses. The initial position was recorded, and masses were added in 100-gram increments, allowing the system to settle before each measurement. The displacement data was recorded and repeated five times for each mass to ensure accuracy. This data was used to create a force versus displacement plot and determine the spring constant .

In parts D through H, we attached a 500-gram mass to the spring without any damping elements and recorded the position over time using LoggerPro. The collected data was imported into MATLAB for analysis, where we plotted displacement, velocity, and acceleration versus time. The position measurements were inverted since the ultrasonic sensor provided decreasing values as the mass moved closer. To ensure the values oscillated around zero, we shifted the position data by its mean, providing a clearer visualization of displacement.We measured the mass of the weight holder and spring for use in further analysis to compare the predicted period of oscillation with experimental results.

In part I and J, we added damping by attaching a paper plate to the weight holder. We measured the equilibrium position with the ultrasonic sensor and set the system in motion, recording the amplitude of oscillation until it decayed to about 50% of its original value over roughly 30 seconds. A phase space plot of velocity versus position was created for further analysis.

**RESULTS AND DISCUSSION**

The results obtained from our experiment illustrate the key differences between undamped and damped harmonic motion. For the undamped case, the oscillation period remained consistent throughout, with minimal decay in amplitude, as expected. The plots of displacement, velocity, and acceleration showed regular sinusoidal patterns with nearly constant amplitude, reflecting ideal simple harmonic motion.

When damping was introduced by attaching the paper plate, the effects were clearly visible in the amplitude decay over time. The displacement plot revealed an exponential decrease in amplitude, indicative of underdamped harmonic motion. By fitting the experimental data to the theoretical model using least-squares fitting, we were able to determine the damping coefficient \(b\), which quantifies the rate of energy loss due to air resistance.

The comparison between the theoretical and experimental periods of oscillation showed a close match for the undamped case, with a percent error of less than 5%. For the damped case, the period increased slightly due to the effect of air resistance, which slows down the system. The phase space plot (velocity versus position) for the damped system formed a spiral pattern, which represents the gradual loss of energy as the system approaches equilibrium.

One of the key observations was how the damping coefficient affects the overall behavior of the oscillator. The higher the damping coefficient, the quicker the amplitude decayed, confirming the relationship between damping and energy dissipation. Our results showed that the model of damped harmonic motion aligns well with experimental observations, demonstrating the reliability of the theoretical approach in predicting real-world behavior.

Overall, this experiment provided a comprehensive understanding of both undamped and damped harmonic motion, highlighting the role of damping in reducing oscillatory energy and altering the dynamic properties of the system.
